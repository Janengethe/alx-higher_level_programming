## 0x04. Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary
> This project entails the data structures in python:
> sets and dictionary. Sets are a collection od unique
> elements that have unsure order. They do not support
> indexing and duplication of values, but support functions
> like add, pop, remove, updaqte, etc. On the other hand,
> dictionary have keys and values of which keys are
> immutable and unique.

### Reference Materials
* [Data structures](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html)
* [Lambda, filter, reduce and map](https://www.python-course.eu/python3_lambda.php)
* [Learn to Program 12 Lambda Map Filter Reduce](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GAC6KQUPeg)

### File Descriptions
0. a function that computes the square value of all integers of a matrix.
1. a function that replaces all occurrences of an element by another in a new list.
2. a function that adds all unique integers in a list (only once for each integer).
3. a function that returns a set of common elements in two sets.
4. a function that returns a set of all elements present in only one set.
5. a function that returns the number of keys in a dictionary.
6. a function that prints a dictionary by ordered keys.
7. a function that replaces or adds key/value in a dictionary.
8. a function that deletes a key in a dictionary.
9. a function that returns a new dictionary with all values multiplied by 2
10. a function that returns a key with the biggest integer value.
11. a function that returns a list with all values multiplied by a number without using any loops.
12. a function def roman_to_int(roman_string): that converts a [Roman numeral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral) to an integer.

### Advance Tasks
1. a function that returns the weighted average of all integers tuple (<score>, <weight>)
2. a function that computes the square value of all integers of a matrix using map
3. a function that deletes keys with a specific value in a dictionary.
