## 0x01. Python - if/else, loops, functions
> This project makes the use of the 'if', 'else', 'loops' and 'functions'
> in Python programming language. These helps to control the flow of the
> program, where you will want to execute a certain line of codes if a
> condition is satisfied, and a different set of code incase it is not.
> Each file in this repo holds a code that is used to illustrate how
> these statements works in Python.

### Requirements
* files interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)
* py code uses the PEP 8 style (version 1.7.*) and c code uses betty-style
* The scripts are all executable (chmod u+x *)

### File Descriptions
#### py files
0. a program that assign a random signed number to the variable number each time it is executed,print whether the random number is positive or negative.
1. a program that assign a random signed number to the variable number each time it is executed,print the last digit of the number stored in prints the alphabet, in lowercase.
2. a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line.
3. a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line.
4. a program that prints all numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and in hexadecimal.
5. a program that prints numbers from 0 to 99.
6. a program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits.
7. a function that checks for lowercase character.
8. a function that prints a string in uppercase followed by a new line.
9. a function that prints the last digit of a number.
10. a function that adds two integers and returns the result.
11. a function that computes a to the power of b and return the value.
12. a function that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 separated by a space.

#### c files
13.a function in C that inserts a number into a sorted singly linked list.

#### Advance
100.a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in reverse order, alternating lowercase and uppercase (z in lowercase and Y in uppercase) , not followed by a new line.
101.a function that creates a copy of the string, removing the character at the position n (not the Python way,the "C array index")
102.the Python function def magic_calculation(a, b, c): that does the exact same way as the given bytecode.
